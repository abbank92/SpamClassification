# SpamClassification
A naive Bayesian classifier trained to identify spam emails


This repository contains files pertaining to an email spam classifier. It is a naive Bayesian classifier trained to identify spam emails. Please read the PDF markdown report for a full explaination of the algorithm, its performance, and various extensions (including a test on my own inbox).

You can find the data used and the code in the `ProjectCode` folder as well as other less-organized notes and bits of code.
