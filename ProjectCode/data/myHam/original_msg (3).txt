Hi Norie,

When you get a chance, I would be super appreciative if you could send me
the workout schedule for this week. I'm looking forward to seeing all of
you!

I came down with some virus over Christmas, and I'm still getting over it,
but I'm hoping to get back in the pool as soon as possible.

Hope you had a good holiday season and hope to see you soon,

Alex
